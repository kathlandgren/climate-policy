    """
    Load simulation results for a given set of parameter combinations and simulation number.

    This function reads majority and minority opinion matrices from pickled files for different
    parameter combinations and organizes the data by swap index. The results are stored in a 
    dictionary for easy access.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    output_folder : str
        Path to the folder containing the simulation result files.
    homophily_values : list of float
        List of homophily values used in the simulations.
    m_values : list of int
        List of `m` values (number of edges per new node) used in the simulations.
    num_agents_values : list of int
        List of agent counts (number of nodes) used in the simulations.
    sim_number : int
        The specific simulation number to load results for.

    Returns:
    --------
    dict
        A dictionary where keys are tuples `(homophily, m, num_agents, swap_idx)`, and values
        are dictionaries containing:
        - "majority": Majority opinion matrix for the specific swap.
        - "minority": Minority opinion matrix for the specific swap.
